# warsim

Small script that creates armies and pits them 
against each other in a simple battle simulation.

Armies are randomly assigned a race which determines their
difference in stats like strength, defense or accuracy.

Battle is done so every soldier takes a turn attacking a
random troop. 

Only thing needed for it to run is passing two
arguments in url "army1" and "army2".

Example: http://localhost:8000/?army1=26&amp;army2=23
